# Dental_Reform_Modelling_2

This is a re-vamp of the dental contract reform model, which was done in excel originally. 
The model was designed to estimate the impact of reform on 1) payments to dentists; 2) Patient Charge Revenue; and 3) Number of patients seen. 

[DRM2] folder contains scripts for the core model which allows different inputs to be tested, so impacts of potential policy changes can be evaluated.
